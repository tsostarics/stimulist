glue_filenames_by(design, ..., as_levels = FALSE)

\arguments{
\item{design}{Experiment design}

\item{...}{A list of formulas mapping stimuli to glue-formatted strings}

\item{as_levels}{Whether to use the labels or integers representing each level}
}
\description{
Requires the {glue} package. Similar syntax to add_stimuli_by(), but here
you're specifying a glue string for a particular stimulus. Glue strings
utilize {brackets} to evaluate an expression within a string. In this case,
you'll be replacing a label in brackets with its value in the
completed_experiment data frame.

This must be run after using fill_experiment.
